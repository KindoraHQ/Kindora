 Kindora (KNR)

Kindora is a BEP20 token deployed on the Binance Smart Chain.  
The project is focused on transparency, long-term safety, and supporting children in need.

 Overview

Kindora uses a fixed tax structure that cannot be changed after deployment.  
Part of the transaction fee supports charity, part is burned, and part contributes to automated liquidity.

Liquidity generated by the contract is permanently locked by sending LP tokens to the DEAD address.  
Trading is disabled at deployment and can only be enabled by the owner during launch.

 Charity

3% of each transaction is allocated for charity.

A portion of every transaction supports liquidity.  
Half of the liquidity tokens are swapped for BNB, and the remainder is added to the liquidity pool.  
Resulting LP tokens are sent to the DEAD address permanently.
